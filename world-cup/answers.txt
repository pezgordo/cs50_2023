Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, 10, 100, and 1000 the predicted winner was Brazil, but as we increased to 10000, 100000, and 1000000 the predicted winner was Belgium.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 (ten thousand) simulations, there would be a big payment increase going from 10000 to 100000 (769% increase) and the top results don't vary much.
