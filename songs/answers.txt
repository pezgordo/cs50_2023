QUESTION: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

ANSWER: Analizing the given data, I would say the listener has an energetic aura because the average energy is 0.66 so the listener has a tendency to like energetic songs.
Also the listener likes music to dance to, the average danceability of the user's top songs is 0.72 so almost 3 in 4 songs is danceable to.
 Regarding Valence, the user has no preference for positive or negative mood of the music he listens to, the valence average is 0.48.

QUESTION: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

ANSWER: I would assign a lesser value to the current popular songs since the listener may play them regardless of their current mood.
Just because the music is popular doesn't necessarily reflect the listener's true mood accurately.
Instead, I would use the songs the listener actively chooses to play to more accurately assess their mood aura.
